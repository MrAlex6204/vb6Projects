I found a DVD backup since 2009 and my first impression was that maybe the laptop won't read it but I get a nice surprise, it was a folder with my first programs code that I made and was a reference.
There are not all programs, I lost a bunch of programs of .Net in a hard disk that broke accidentally.
These programs was my motivation during I was in the school and I feel sad when I remember these lost.
